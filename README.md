# Car Rental Application
This application allows users to rent cars from a decentralized car rental platform. It leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to manage car rental transactions securely and transparently.

# Key Features:

1. Car Listing: Users can view a list of available cars for rent, including details such as the car model, price per day, and rental status.

2. Renting Cars: Users can rent cars by specifying the number of days they want to rent and making the appropriate payment using cryptocurrency.

3. Returning Cars: Once a user has finished renting a car, they can return it through the application.

4. Adding Cars: Owners of the rental platform can add new cars to the platform, specifying details such as the car model and price per day.

# How it Works:

- The application connects to the Ethereum blockchain using MetaMask, allowing users to interact with the smart contract deployed on the blockchain.

- Smart contracts handle the logic for adding, renting, and returning cars. They ensure that transactions are executed securely and that rental agreements are enforced transparently.

- Users can browse the list of available cars, rent a car by specifying the rental duration, and return the car once the rental period is over.

- Owners of the rental platform have special permissions to add new cars to the platform and manage existing listings.
